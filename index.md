## SOAR Project Management Guide for Beginners

SOAR refers to technologies that enable organizations to collect inputs monitored by the security operations team. For example, alerts from the SIEM system and other security technologies — where incident analysis and triage can be performed by leveraging a combination of human and machine power — help define, prioritize and drive standardized incident response activities. SOAR tools allow an organization to define incident analysis and response procedures in a digital workflow format. (Gartner's SOAR definition)

"The key to a successful SOAR implementation is training security
professionals in how to develop a process, document it and
automate it." Gartner


I prepared this page for sharing my experience and best practices for SOC - SOAR Projects. If you have any questions or suggestions please do not hesitate to reach out to me.


### Challenges

- High Volume Alarms/Offenses
- Manuel Investigations
- A dizzying array of tools to respond
- Threat Intelligence checks for IPs,URLs,DOMAINs,HASHes
- Regulations

### Key benefits of SOAR projects

- Triage and consolidate alerts
- Customize enrichment
- Orchestrate (and automate) response

### Common mistakes about SOAR projects
- Automation-integration/ or Playbook development idea without developer talent. I think this is one of the most critical mistakes. Automation effort is inevitable when designing a real end-to-end value-added automation playbook. For this reason, if you want to get the maximum benefit from a SOAR project, I recommend having more than one engineer in your team, if possible, who can develop these playbooks. If you do not have a team with this competence, you may have to face the fact that your SOAR project will not have enough dynamism. If you are thinking of solving this problem with outsourcing Playbook development service, I recommend that you make sure that the outsource company you receive service from has a swat team with sufficient technical skills.
- Lack of design sessions for developing value-added Playbook ideas. This is another important problem which I have seen in several projects. And the root cause of this problem is directly related with communication and technical skills. I suggest regular meetings with your SOAR consultant for exploring Playbook ideas (if your consultant does not enough technical skills and experience, this method may not work healthy). SOAR is just a platform that includes some out-of-box playbooks and integrations. But in real world value-added Playbook ideas for making your life easir in your daily CSOC operations should be discussed with your team in Playbook design sessions. SOAR projects don't work like plug-and-play solutions. Your SOAR project should customize with your needs and should help your daily operations and should solve problems which are specific for your company. And if you want to implement an ideal SOAR project please do not focus only automation and integrations, focus to ideas and scenarios which can make your life easier.
