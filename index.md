## SOAR Project Management Guide for Beginners

SOAR refers to technologies that enable organizations to collect inputs monitored by the security operations team. For example, alerts from the SIEM system and other security technologies — where incident analysis and triage can be performed by leveraging a combination of human and machine power — help define, prioritize and drive standardized incident response activities. SOAR tools allow an organization to define incident analysis and response procedures in a digital workflow format. (Gartner's SOAR definition)

"The key to a successful SOAR implementation is training security
professionals in how to develop a process, document it and
automate it." Gartner

### Challenges

- High Volume Alarms/Offenses
- Manuel Investigations
- A dizzying array of tools to respond
- Threat Intelligence checks for IPs,URLs,DOMAINs,HASHes
- Regulations

### Key benefits of SOAR projects

- Triage and consolidate alerts
- Customize enrichment
- Orchestrate (and automate) response

### Common mistakes about SOAR projects
- Automation-integration/ or Playbook development idea without developer talent. I think this is one of the most critical mistakes. Automation effort is inevitable when designing a real end-to-end value-added automation playbook. For this reason, if you want to get the maximum benefit from a SOAR project, I recommend having more than one engineer in your team, if possible, who can develop these playbooks. If you do not have a team with this competence, you may have to face the fact that your SOAR project will not have enough dynamism. If you are thinking of solving this problem with outsourcing Playbook development service, I recommend that you make sure that the outsource company you receive service from has a swat team with sufficient technical skills.
